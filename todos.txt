Will keep a list of todos here 

- zero players bug. If no players are added to setup form we are currently still able to set up a round

- change the text in the info card when you select a round type (number of holes)

- got some wierd bugs in my set up form

- the use effect is doing something weird and causing it to not work properly when you refresh

- need to make sure my round finishes at the right place somehow

- still some serious bugs in the initial form and final scorecard

- My options thing is not a one and done at the initial set up because it relies on the updated scorecards.... will need to fix this.

-Try to find a golf course API and use it to load in all of the gold courses in NZ if possible

- next is to clean up the info card (info appears correctly when selected) and to make the forms disappear when selected
