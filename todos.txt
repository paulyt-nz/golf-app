Will keep a list of todos here 

- zero players bug. If no players are added to setup form we are currently still able to set up a round

- change the text in the info card when you select a round type (number of holes)

- got some wierd bugs in my set up form

- the use effect is doing something weird and causing it to not work properly when you refresh

- need to make sure my round finishes at the right place somehow
